# Django Vue Template ‚úåÔ∏è üêç

This template is a minimal example for an application using Vue and Django.

It's setup to have a clear separation: use Vue, Yarn, and Webpack to handle all frontend logic and assets bundling,
and use Django with Django REST framework to manage a Data Models, Web API, and serve static files.

While it's possible to add endpoints to serve django-rendered html responses, the intention is to use Django primarily for the backend, and have view rendering and routing and handled by Vue + Vue Router as a Single Page Application (SPA).

Out of the box, Django will serve the application entry point (`index.html` + bundled assets) at `/` ,
data at `/api/`, and static files at `/static/`. Django admin panel is also available at `/admin/` and can be extended as needed.

The application templates from Vue CLI `create` and Django `createproject` are kept as close as possible to their
original state, except where a different configuration is needed for better integration of the two frameworks.
